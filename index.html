      <h2>why the Title</h2>
      More Neutral and Positive:
"Born a crime" carries a negative stigma and emphasizes the illegality of Noah's birth. "Mixed Root"  is more neutral and positive, focusing on the beautiful and complex tapestry of his ancestry.
Focus on Heritage:
"Mixed Root"  highlight's the blending of different cultures and ancestries, which is a key theme in Noah's story.
More Inclusive:
"Mixed Root"   is inclusive of other mixed-race individuals and their stories, rather than focusing solely on the historical context of apartheid

            How the above  quote resonates gender Roles
        </h2>
        <p>Patricia is depicted as a strong, independent woman who defies societal expectations. She actively seeks opportunities for herself and her son, even facing opposition from Abel and his family. She chooses to be in Johannesburg, a place illegal for a Black person to be, highlighting her defiance of the system. <br>
            Abel, on the other hand, embodies traditional gender roles. He desires a wife who is subservient and conforms to his expectations, rather than an individual like his wife who is intellectual and independent. This is reflected in his frustration with Patricia's independence and her decision to go to church all day on Sundays. 
            Abel's desire for a traditional wife ,highlights the complex nature of patriarchal expectations, where men desire control but are also drawn to women who challenge those expectations
            The clash between Patricia's independent nature and Abel's desire for control creates significant tension in their relationship and in Trevor's life. This tension is fueled by the patriarchal values that Abel embodies and the society in which they live.

    <h1>Personal insights</h1>
    <p> if being submissive  was neutral to women , there wouldn't be thousands of sermons everyday remainding  women to submit.Women have a stand  and its okay to  say no if things doesn't work out accordingly  and  being independent  as a woman is  a key thing to avoid manipulation and abusive acts ffrom men . 
        Women should not mind about what the community says 
        about them rather thy should focus on themselves first. </p>
